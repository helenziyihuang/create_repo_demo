\f0\fs24 \cf0 The purpose of creating this GitHub tutorial is to provide a detailed guide for GitHub beginners. Although there are lots of resources out there on our course websites, many feedback suggests that they are still hard for beginners. Things can be easily messed up and students can easily get stuck when first uses GitHub.\
This guide explains what, why, and how each command works in details. Many notes are added as well to explain the steps that cause most confusions. It also suggest potential problems student may run into if do the wrong thing so that they can be able to deal with the issue instead of completely lost.\
I assume this guide is for the very very beginners. There are many other additional things can be added to this guide. However, due to time constrain, it is a very rough draft and can be improved in a lot of ways. In addition, due to language limits, some of my explanations might not be the most concise/accurate.}
